in task1.c 

I do iteration with

while (k > 0) {
    n = n + k;
    k =  k / 10;  
}

Which, take time complexity is Log(On)
Because each iteration is devide k by 10, Log(n) + K time

I do recursive with 

int Harshad(int num) {
    if ( num == 0) {
        return num;
    }
    return num + Harshad(num / 10);
}

Which, take time complexity is OLog(n)
